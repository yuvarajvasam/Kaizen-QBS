git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure project settings:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `./` (default)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (default)
   - Output Directory: `.next` (default)
5. Add Environment Variables:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
6. Click "Deploy"

#### Option B: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? [your-account]
# - Link to existing project? N
# - What's your project's name? ai-question-bank-solver
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
# - Want to override the settings? N
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In your Vercel project dashboard:
1. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
   ```
   Name: GEMINI_API_KEY
   Value: your_actual_gemini_api_key
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development
   ```
3. Redeploy if needed

### 4. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] PDF upload functionality works
- [ ] AI processing works
- [ ] PDF generation works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works

## Post-Deployment

### ✅ Monitor Performance
- [ ] Check Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Monitor function execution times
- [ ] Check for any 500 errors
- [ ] Verify PDF generation timeout (30s)

### ✅ Test All Features
- [ ] PDF upload and parsing
- [ ] Module selection
- [ ] Part selection (A, B, C)
- [ ] Solution generation
- [ ] Export functionality (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Dark mode

### ✅ Security
- [ ] API key is properly secured
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Rate limiting (if needed)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build locally
npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

#### Environment Variables
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel dashboard
- Redeploy after adding environment variables

#### PDF Generation Timeout
- Function timeout is set to 30 seconds in `vercel.json`
- Consider optimizing PDF generation for large documents

#### Puppeteer Issues
- Puppeteer is configured for serverless deployment
- Check Vercel function logs for any Puppeteer errors

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Next.js 14 optimizations enabled
- [ ] Image optimization configured
- [ ] Server components external packages configured
- [ ] Webpack optimizations for serverless

### ✅ Monitoring
- [ ] Vercel Analytics enabled
- [ ] Function execution monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking (if needed)

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally with production build
4. Check Vercel documentation
5. Create an issue in the repository
